        <p>He was also known for numerous other things, among them being that he joined his first major league at the young age of <i>16</i>! 
            He also single handedly boosted the morale and power of the not-very-good team that he joined: The Peterborough Petes.
</p>
        <p>But perhaps the greatest thing about Gretzky was, is that he never let the attention go to his head, which was incredible because it was <em>so much</em> 
            attention. He never once slipped up and gloated, he never had that dark side of him where he gloated to his losers and then suddenly lost the game, he was just 
            <i>that</i> in control of his emotions and was <i>that</i> good at hockey.

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Saute. Heat the olive oil in a medium skillet over medium high heat. Add the chicken and season with steak seasoning. 
            Saute until chicken is almost cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Stretch. Preheat your oven to 425 degrees F. Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray. Stretch the pizza dough and press into the baking
            sheet. It will tend to spring back, but keep stretching it out and it will stay. Letting the dough rest for several minutes will also relax the dough and make
            it easier to press out.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Top. Spread 1 cup shredded cheese over the dough. Top with the sliced peppers, onions, mushrooms and cooked chicken.
            Sprinkle with remaining 1 cup of shredded cheese.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Serve. Place Cheese Steak Pizza in the oven on the lowest rack and bake for 20 minutes or until golden brown. Chicken is done when a meat 
    thermometer inserted in the center reaches 165 degrees F Enjoy with a cold beverage!
