        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Saute. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Season chicken with Chinese five-spice powder,
            salt and pepper. Sauté chicken thighs 5 to 7 minutes per side, until chicken is browned. Transfer chicken to plate. When cool, slice thighs into strips.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Simmer. Remove all but 1 teaspoon oil from Dutch oven and heat over medium-high heat. Add garlic and ginger, and sauté until fragrant,
            about 30 to 45 seconds. Add chicken stock, soy sauce and sugar. Remove stems from shiitake mushrooms, slice into strips and add to broth. Bring to boil,
            reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes. Add baby bok choy and sliced thighs to broth and simmer about 5 minutes or until bok choy is tender and chicken is cooked
            through.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Serve. Divide cooked ramen noodles into 4 bowls. Ladle in broth. Add mushrooms and bok choy from broth. Top with sliced chicken, 
            scallions and hard-boiled eggs. Serve with Sriracha sauce and lime wedges on side.

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Saute. Heat the olive oil in a medium skillet over medium high heat. Add the chicken and season with steak seasoning. 
            Saute until chicken is almost cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Stretch. Preheat your oven to 425 degrees F. Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray. Stretch the pizza dough and press into the baking
            sheet. It will tend to spring back, but keep stretching it out and it will stay. Letting the dough rest for several minutes will also relax the dough and make
            it easier to press out.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Top. Spread 1 cup shredded cheese over the dough. Top with the sliced peppers, onions, mushrooms and cooked chicken.
            Sprinkle with remaining 1 cup of shredded cheese.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Serve. Place Cheese Steak Pizza in the oven on the lowest rack and bake for 20 minutes or until golden brown. Chicken is done when a meat 
    thermometer inserted in the center reaches 165 degrees F Enjoy with a cold beverage!
