        <p>He was also known for numerous other things, among them being that he joined his first major league at the young age of <i>16</i>! 
            He also single handedly boosted the morale and power of the not-very-good team that he joined: The Peterborough Petes.
</p>
        <p>But perhaps the greatest thing about Gretzky was, is that he never let the attention go to his head, which was incredible because it was <em>so much</em> 
            attention. He never once slipped up and gloated, he never had that dark side of him where he gloated to his losers and then suddenly lost the game, he was 
            just <i>that</i> in control of his emotions and was <i>that</i> good at hockey.

        <p>He completely changed the NHL by spreading it's fame and glory across North America when he was sent to Los Angeles in a trade. 
</p>
        <p>To be truthful, according to USA Today, nobody would know much about hockey in the South U.S. if it wasnâ€™t for Gretzky. 
            He did all of this just because he loved hockey and shows how much he enjoys and wants to share the sport with others. This shows how great of a player he is 
            and how great of a human being he is.
